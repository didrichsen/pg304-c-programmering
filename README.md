# PG3401 C programming

This repository accompanies me through the C programming course at Kristiana University College.

## Structure

Folders are organized based on either lectures, with tasks related to that week's topic, or more specific subjects I've explored.

### Credits

- Code found under "lecturer" directories are solution examples provided by Bengt Østby, a lecturer at Kristiana University College.
- The repository also features a debugger inspired by Bengt Østby's debugger.

## Course Summary

### Knowledge

- Familiarity with Unix and Linux operating system families: background, history, overall architecture, and structure.
- Understanding of the development and usage of the "C" programming language.
- Comprehension of the concept of "virtualization."
- Knowledge of the build process in C, including compilation and linking.
- Ability to explain the concept of "everything is a file" and familiarity with examples such as devices and procfs.
- Understanding of what a "filesystem" is and its purpose.
- Grasp of the concepts of users and permissions in Linux.
- Awareness of the difference between userspace and kernelspace and how to use system calls and signals.
- Familiarity with the memory areas "stack" and "heap" and the ability to explain the difference.
- Understanding of the concept of "buffer overflow" and why it is dangerous.

### Skills

- Ability to utilize basic constructs in the "C" programming language, including: main function, basic data types, printf, scanf, strings, #include, include guards, enum, typedef, struct, union, command line parameters, macros, vararg, and static memory management.
- Proficiency in developing programs following the structured programming paradigm.
- Correct usage of the keyword "const."
- Application of dynamic memory management, including: malloc, free, pointers, memcpy, sprintf, arrays, and sizeof.
- Capability to read and write individual bits and groups of bits into a larger data structure.
- Competence in generating executable files from C code using makefile and static libraries.
- Implementation of file reading and writing operations, including: read/write modes, seek, and buffer size.
- Operation of the command line in Linux to perform essential operations, including: ls, cd, mkdir, rm, cp, chmod, chown, pwd, ps, kill, man, wget, pipes, redirection, starting programs, and mounting filesystems.
- Creation of programs that avoid buffer overflow.
- Understanding and application of threads to perform tasks in parallel.
- Understanding and utilization of sockets to communicate between machines over a network.

**Work in Progress:** This project is currently under development, and updates will be made periodically during the rest
of the course.
