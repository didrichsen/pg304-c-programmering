In practical programming, it is often efficient to lay out time-consuming operations in working threads,
examples of which are file operations, network operations and communication with external devices.
In this task, you will simulate such operations with a smaller data set.

You are going to create an application that consists of 2 threads,
the main thread (which started main) and a working thread that will write data.
When the main thread starts, it should first start the working thread with mechanisms for
thread communication and synchronization. The main thread and work thread should have a memory
area with room for 10 characters. (It can be a struct that also contains other control data such as
the number of characters in the buffer and other things the student finds usefulâ€” but no more than 10 characters as a text buffer.
It is permissible for such a struct to contain char a[11] if the eleventh character is used only for a 0-termination.)
